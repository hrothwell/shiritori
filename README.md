Primarily a personal project and a means to experiment working with web sockets, deploying to AWS, etc. 

# Running
This application is packaged as a "fat" jar. Tomcat should not be required to run the server. Steps to run:
1. Clone the repo
2. In project root, run `./gradlew build`
3. Locate jar file in `build/libs/shiritori.jar`
4. Open CMD/terminal/PowerShell/etc to file location and run: `java -jar shiritori.jar` to start the server
5. Once startup is complete, the server should be running at `localhost:80`!
